I chose to simulate a popular game CS:GO. I created a class for player where it is stored the information and stats of the player, next I created a class for the camera position to monitor the player looking area, next class is for movement to store the location of the player on the map, and additionally to this another class Special() that is meant for jumping, crouching and sneaking. Another group of classes are Shoot to check the shooting between actors and class Weapons to save the weapon used, next is class Bomb for the bomb event, an class Radar to have the location of the player on the map, a Buy class to have the buy menu for the player and a money class to store the money of each player. A class Kill where the death of a player is shown and finally a PlayerTab class to see how many remaining actors are in the current round of the game.
